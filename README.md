## My C++ Code Templates
Feel free to use these when you solve competitive programming problems!

## Source
Most of these templates are written by myself. Some are sourced from KACTL (https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl), with some of my modifications.

## Usage
Simply copy paste the structs into your code. All code assumes you are using namespace std and have included all necessary headers.
